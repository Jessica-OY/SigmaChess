# Sigma Go - Chess AI Project

## Project Overview
A machine learning project focused on building a Chess AI from basic to advanced levels through practical implementation.

## Participants
- [Jessica OY](https://github.com/Jessica-OY) - Basic strategies implementation
- [di0de13](https://github.com/di0de13) - Board logic and UI development

## Current Progress
- ✔️ Chess board logic and user interface completed
- ✔️ Basic AI strategies implemented:
  - Minimax algorithm
  - Alpha-beta pruning

## Roadmap
### Short-term Goals
- Implement fine-tuning using chess game records (potential SFT approach)
- Add Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation

### Long-term Goals
- Develop self-play reinforcement learning capabilities
- Explore advanced neural network architectures
